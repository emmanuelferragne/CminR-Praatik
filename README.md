# CminR-Praatik
I wrote these Praat and R scripts for a doctoral seminar I teach at Universit√© Paris Diderot. My aim was to establish a consistent workflow to manually measure **vowel formants**.
## Getting started
The easiest way to start with the programs is to use the demo files in the folder `formantDemo` :

Make sure [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) is installed on your computer

Download `cp_formants.praat`and the `formantDemo` folder

Edit `file.txt` and adapt the paths to your own directories

Run `cp_formants.praat` :
* when prompted to load a file list, choose `file.txt`
* when prompted to load the dictionary file, choose `dico.txt`
* the annotion is on tier number 1 for this example
